Make sure you have the terminal open in the same directory that you downloaded the IQ file to. Change `<IQ_FILENAME.iq>` to be your IQ file name. Change `<USERNAME>@<HOSTNAME>` to be the `username@hostname` (written after `ssh`) listed for each node in the SSH command column in List View of your experiment.
