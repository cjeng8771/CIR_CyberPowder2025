# IH4: OTA Channel Impulse Response Measurement
Channel Impulse Response Tutorial for CyberPowder2025 - 1/31/2025

In this in-class hands-on activity, you will
1. Create an IQ file from PN codes
2. Use Shout to transmit and receive between two nodes
3. Cross-correlate the filtered received signal with the original PN code packet to observe the channel impulse response and multipath

Follow the instructions and code in this [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1qUp7MgBtZ0hp3xUQEjaLpNL7Er2nQ7RM?usp=sharing) to walk through all the steps. This is a Read-Only document so you will need to save a copy to Drive to make edits.

If you prefer, this repository includes a `IH4_OTA_Channel_Impulse_Response_CyberPowder2025.ipynb` file you can download to follow the instructions and code on your local machine rather than using Google Colab. You will not need to upload your files. Instead, make sure to download the `IH4_OTA_Channel_Impulse_Response_CyberPowder2025.ipynb` file into a directory of choice that you'll use as the working directory during the tutorial.
