# IH4: OTA Channel Impulse Response Measurement
Channel Impulse Response Tutorial for CyberPowder2025 - 1/31/2025

In this in-class hands-on activity, you will
1. Create an IQ file from PN codes
2. Use Shout to transmit and receive your IQ file between two nodes
3. Cross-correlate the filtered received signal with your original PN code packet to observe the channel impulse response

## Background: Pseudo-noise (PN) Codes
In contrast to the packets transmitted and received with your receiver design in IH3 and HH2, in this activity, you will create, transmit, and receive a BPSK maximum length pseudo-noise (PN) code packet, omitting both the preamble and sync word.

PN codes are generated using a linear feedback shift register (LFSR) and are semi-random sequences that repeat themselves indefinitely. They have a clean auto-correlation function, can be easily phase synchronized even in the presence of noise, and therefore serve as convenient digital communication system test signals [1].

A N-state PN code will have `2^N - 1` bits. The LFSR starts with an initial state N-dimensional vector, which cannot be all zeros but can have any other combination of ones and zeros. It uses specified taps, which are unique depending on the chosen N, to generate different resulting sequences, as shown in Table 2 of [1].

## Instructions

Follow the instructions and code outlined in the [IH4 OTA Channel Impulse Response CyberPowder2025 Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1qUp7MgBtZ0hp3xUQEjaLpNL7Er2nQ7RM?usp=sharing). This is a read-only notebook so you will need to save a copy to Drive to make edits. 
  * If you prefer to use Jupyter Notebook, this repository includes a `IH4_OTA_Channel_Impulse_Response_CyberPowder2025.ipynb` file you can download to follow the instructions and code on your local machine rather than using Google Colab. You will not need to upload your files. Instead, make sure to download the python notebook file into a directory of choice that you'll use as the working directory during the tutorial.

You will need to download `save_iq_w_tx_file.json` for use in this activity.

Run through the code cells in the notebook sequentially. Sections that need you to complete part of the code or some other task will be marked with a ðŸ›‘ icon (code to be filled in will also have `### TODO ###` on the line to complete).

Below is the per-group information to reference for running your Shout experiments. Running the experiment will require multiple terminal windows in addition to having the code open. You can either have each person operate a different task or have a group representative share their screen while walking through the steps.

*Turn In:* At the end of the notebook, you should have cross-correlation plots that show the channel impulse response for your experiment. Save the figures and add them to this [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1V2pEICyCiz0p0sV33NMLEAHHvUstUNarXrIf07RETuw/edit?usp=sharing) for your group. Fill in the requested parameters in the document as well. You can see the channel impulse responses that other teams received with their PN code packet and nodes.
